* [NYT review of The Plutonium Files](https://archive.nytimes.com/www.nytimes.com/books/first/w/welsome-plutonium.html)
    *  When the mouth washings finally were finished, Hempelmann ordered the
       young man to lie down on a cot. Then he pumped out his stomach several
       times. Carefully he transferred the stomach liquids into a tall beaker. The
       plutonium would have to be chemically separated from the organic matter in
       Mastick's stomach and mouth so it could be reused in future experiments. No
       scientist at the lab had ever undertaken such a task.

       Hempelmann gave the young chemist a couple of breakfast waffles for his
       empty stomach and some Sippy alkaline powders to be taken during the day. Then
       he turned and handed him the four-liter beaker of murky liquid.

       Go, he said, retrieve the plutonium.

      Simp.
         Your discussion is really admirable; yet I do not find it easy to
         believe that a bird-shot falls as swiftly as a cannon ball.

      Salv.
         Why not say a grain of sand as rapidly as a grindstone? But,
         Simplicio, I trust you will not follow the example of many others who divert
         the discussion from its main intent and fasten upon some statement of mine
         which lacks a hair's-breadth of the truth and, under this hair, hide the fault
         of another which is as big as a ship's cable. Aristotle says that “an iron ball
         of one hundred pounds falling from a height of one hundred cubits reaches the
         ground before a one-pound ball has fallen a single cubit.” I say that they
         arrive at the same time. You find, on [65] making the experiment, that the
         larger outstrips the smaller by two finger-breadths, that is, when the larger
         has reached the ground, the other is short of it by two finger-breadths; now
         you would not hide behind these two fingers the ninety-nine cubits of
         Aristotle, nor would you mention my small error and at the same time pass over
         in silence his very large one. Aristotle declares that bodies of different
         weights, in the same medium, travel (in so far as their motion depends upon
         gravity) with speeds which are proportional to their weights; this he
         illustrates by use of bodies in which it is possible to perceive the pure and
         unadulterated effect of gravity, eliminating other considerations, for example,
         figure as being of small importance [minimi momenti], influences which are
         greatly dependent upon the medium which modifies the single effect of gravity
         alone. Thus we observe that gold, the densest of all substances, when beaten
         out into a very thin leaf, goes floating through the air; the same thing
         happens with stone when ground into a very fine powder. But if you wish to
         maintain the general proposition you will have to show that the same ratio of
         speeds is preserved in the[110] case of all heavy bodies, and that a stone of
         twenty pounds moves ten times as rapidly as one of two; but I claim that this
         is false and that, if they fall from a height of fifty or a hundred cubits,
         they will reach the earth at the same moment.

     Simp.
         Perhaps the result would be different if the fall took place not from
         a few cubits but from some thousands of cubits.

     Salv.
         If this were what Aristotle meant you would burden him with another
         error which would amount to a falsehood; because, since there is no such sheer
         height available on earth, it is clear that Aristotle could not have made the
         experiment; yet he wishes to give us the impression of his having performed it
         when he speaks of such an effect as one which we see.

     Simp.
         In fact, Aristotle does not employ this principle, but uses the other
         one which is not, I believe, subject to these same difficulties.

     Salv.
         But the one is as false as the other; and I am surprised that you
         yourself do not see the fallacy and that you do not [66] perceive that if it
         were true that, in media of different densities and different resistances, such
         as water and air, one and the same body moved in air more rapidly than in
         water, in proportion as the density of water is greater than that of air, then
         it would follow that any body which falls through air ought also to fall
         through water. But this conclusion is false inasmuch as many bodies which
         descend in air not only do not descend in water, but actually rise.

     Simp.
         I do not understand the necessity of your inference; and in addition I
         will say that Aristotle discusses only those bodies which fall in both media,
         not those which fall in air but rise in water.

     Salv.
         The arguments which you advance for the Philosopher are such as he
         himself would have certainly avoided so as not to aggravate his first mistake.

* Anathem exceprts:
  * ```
    Bulshytt: (1) In Fluccish of the late Praxic Age and early Reconstitution,
    a derogatory term for false speech in general, esp. knowing and deliberate
    falsehood or obfuscation. (2) In Orth, a more technical and clinical term
    denoting speech (typically but not necessarily commercial or political) that
    employs euphemism, convenient vagueness, numbing repetition, and other such
    rhetorical subterfuges to create the impression that something has been said.
    (3) According to the Knights of Saunt Halikaarn, a radical order of the 2nd
    Millennium A.R., all speech and writings of the ancient Sphenics; the
    Mystagogues of the Old Mathic Age; Praxic Age commercial and political
    institutions; and, since the Reconstitution, anyone they deemed to have been
    infected by Procian thinking. Their frequent and loud use of this word to
    interrupt lectures, dialogs, private conversations, etc., exacerbated the
    divide between Procian and Halikaarnian orders that characterized the mathic
    world in the years leading up to the Third Sack. Shortly before the Third Sack,
    all of the Knights of Saunt Halikaarn were Thrown Back, so little more is known
    about them (their frequent appearance in Sæcular entertainments results from
    confusion between them and the Incanters).  Usage note: In the mathic world, if
    the word is suddenly shouted out in a chalk hall or refectory it brings to mind
    the events associated with sense (3) and is therefore to be avoided. Spoken in
    a moderate tone of voice, it takes on sense (2), which long ago lost any vulgar
    connotations it may once have had. In the Sæculum it is easily confused with
    sense (1) and deemed a vulgarity or even an obscenity. It is inherent in the
    mentality of extramuros bulshytt-talkers that they are more prone than anyone
    else to taking offense (or pretending to) when their bulshytt is pointed out to
    them. This places the mathic observer in a nearly impossible position. One is
    forced either to use this “offensive” word and be deemed a disagreeable person
    and as such excluded from polite discourse, or to say the same thing in a
    different way, which means becoming a purveyor of bulshytt oneself and thereby
    lending strength to what one is trying to attack. The latter quality probably
    explains the uncanny stability and resiliency of bulshytt. Resolving this
    dilemma is beyond the scope of this Dictionary and is probably best left to
    hierarchs who make it their business to interact with the Sæculum.

* An exceprt from Charlie Stross's ["Accelerando"](http://www.antipope.org/charlie/blog-static/fiction/accelerando/accelerando-intro.html):
  * ```
    One of his e-mail accounts is halfway to the moon with automatic messages,
    companies with names like agalmic.holdings.root.8E.F0 screaming for the
    attention of their transitive director. Each of these companies – and there are
    currently more than sixteen thousand of them, although the herd is growing day
    by day – has three directors and is the director of three other companies. Each
    of them executes a script in a functional language Manfred invented; the
    directors tell the company what to do, and the instructions include orders to
    pass instructions on to their children. In effect, they are a flock of cellular
    automata, like the cells in Conway's Game of Life, only far more complex and
    powerful.
    
    Manfred's companies form a programmable grid. Some of them are armed with
    capital in the form of patents Manfred filed, then delegated rather than
    passing on to one of the Free Foundations. Some of them are effectively
    nontrading, but occupy directorial roles. Their corporate functions (such as
    filing of accounts and voting in new directors) are all handled centrally
    through his company-operating framework, and their trading is carried out via
    several of the more popular B2B enabler dot-coms. Internally, the companies do
    other, more obscure load-balancing computations, processing resource-allocation
    problems like a classic state central planning system. None of which explains
    why fully half of them have been hit by lawsuits in the past twenty-two hours.
